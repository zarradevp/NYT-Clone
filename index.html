                <h5>By Denis Diaconu</h5>
                <time datetime="2014-03-17T13:53">March 17, 2014</time>
                <p>
                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, 
                    an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                    with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, 
                    stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
                    venturing far beyond the world of known physics. 
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of 
                    some exotic particles that should have been created 
                    in the Big Bang. 
                    Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang 
                    to begin with. 
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution 
                    could have infused space itself with a special energy 
                    that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe 
                    to swell faster than the speed of light for 
                    a prodigiously violent instant. 
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why 
                    the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
                    warped mess. 
                    The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. 
                    Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                    like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” 
                    Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it. 
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported 
                    that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, 
                    known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            <div class="c-art4">
                <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes 
                    at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian 
                    Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called 
                    gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it 
                    was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the 
                    long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, 
                    that Dr. Guth was correct. Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, 
                    though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved. If corroborated, 
                    Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of 
                    dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms 
                    of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
    
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years 
                    in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a 
                    larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own 
                    universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, 
                    like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
    
                <p>'As Big as It Gets'</p>
    
                <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
                    forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into 
                    gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational 
                    waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle 
                    space-time.</p>
    
                <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of 
                    the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a signal from 
                    the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
    
                <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation 
                    that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old 
                    and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
    
                <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background 
                    Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific 
                    briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to 
                    The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
